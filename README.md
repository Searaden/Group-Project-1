# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [](#)
  - [Description](#description)
  - [Table of Contents (Optional)](#table-of-contents-optional)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Credits](#credits)
  - [License](#license)
  - [Future-Development](#future-development)
  - [Elevator-Pitch](#elevator-pitch)

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.


## Future-Development

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Elevator-Pitch

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.


// Just checking in with some changes to be applied //
As a bad movie fanatic, I want to create an app/website that will recommend a new movie for me to watch that I have not already seen so I can find new films based on my criteria entered.

SCOPE:

1. See random movies sugestions with description from OMDB
2. See location of theaters near you from google maps

Next Steps:
1. Add trailers rather than movie image
2. Add abilitiy to "like" a trailer creating a list of movies for the user
3. Add search functionality to narrow scope
4.

PKNOLA making notes to readme

A good Readme.md file should have the following:
    a. Know thier audience
        1. End Users
        2. Technical Users
        3. Contributors

     End Users = those looking to not waste time and money on bad movies
     Technical Users = those coders or hackers that love nothing better to do but find bugs or place comments
     Contributors = those who originally worked on the project and those after that made suggestions used to enhance it

Use headers and bulleted list that are structured 
    a. keeping each simple, short and sweet
        1. what project is about
        2. how to install or how to get started with it
        3. how to get involved or collaborate on project
        4. list technologies or frameworks used (if it is not obvious) and state what you found interesting or useful - 

I put a link in the slack - we will re-write this readme file
