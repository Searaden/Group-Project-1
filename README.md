# Group-Project-1

As a Sci-Fi fanatic, I want to create an app/website that will recommend a new movie for me to watch that I have not already seen so I can find new films based on my criteria entered.

SCOPE:

1. See random SciFi movies sugestions with description from OMDB
2. See review scores from rotten tomatoes
3. Save data from user storage when they select if a movie was seen so they are not recommended it again

Next Steps:
1. Add trailers rather than movie image
2. Add abilitiy to "like" a trailer creating a list of movies for the user
3. Add search functionality to narrow scope
4.
