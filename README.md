# Group-Project-1

// Just checking in with some changes to be applied //
As a Sci-Fi fanatic, I want to create an app/website that will recommend a new movie for me to watch that I have not already seen so I can find new films based on my criteria entered.

SCOPE:

1. See random movies sugestions with description from OMDB
2. See location of theaters near you from google maps

Next Steps:
1. Add trailers rather than movie image
2. Add abilitiy to "like" a trailer creating a list of movies for the user
3. Add search functionality to narrow scope
4.

PKNOLA making notes to readme

A good Readme.md file should have the following:
    a. Know thier audience
        1. End Users
        2. Technical Users
        3. Contributors

     End Users = those looking to not waste time and money on bad movies
     Technical Users = those coders or hackers that love nothing better to do but find bugs or place comments
     Contributors = those who originally worked on the project and those after that made suggestions used to enhance it

Use headers and bulleted list that are structured 
    a. keeping each simple, short and sweet
        1. what project is about
        2. how to install or how to get started with it
        3. how to get involved or collaborate on project
        4. list technologies or frameworks used (if it is not obvious) and state what you found interesting or useful - 

I put a link in the slack - we will re-write this readme file
