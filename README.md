# Project Hyperion!

## User Story 
- As an enjoyer of cult classic movies, I want to be able to discover and receive recommendations for cult classic movies so that I can easily find and watch interesting films without spending excessive time searching for them, while also seeing their ratings and trailers, all in one place.

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    * We developed this app because all of us have spent countless hours scrolling through netflix or other streaming applications, without ever finding anything to watch. We wanted to simplify this so that we can spend more time watching movies, and less time searching for a cult classic movie to watch.
 
- Why did you build this project?
    * We decided to create this app so that everyone else can focus on watching movies, instead of googling movies to watch. This way you can spend more time enjoying quality time with your loved ones
- What problem does it solve?
    * It solves the problem of spending countless hours (over a period of time) scrolling to FIND a movie, instead of just watching the movies. Leaving more time to watch more movies.
- What did you learn?
    * The most important thing we learned was how to work together. Committing through github as a group was probably the most difficult task. Learning how to respect each others time, and not commit over each other was the most difficult.
    * Secondly, we learned how to use two different API's (OMDB and Youtube). Both came with their own seperate challenges, but we ultimately were able to get through them together, as a team.
    * The most fascinating thing we learned was how to imbed youtube links into a modal, and link videos to our applications/websites!

## Usage

We tried to keep the website as simplistic as possible for the user.
- This is the default webpage you will see when you open the site (Movie may be different)

- To pull up the trailer you would click the "See Trailer" Button (Circled in white).

- To reroll to another movie, you would click either the "Seen it" (Saves to your Local Storage so that it doesn't appear again), or "Reroll Movie" to just shuffle again (without adding to the Local Storage)

- NOTE: Repeated fast refreshes may cause errors with loading trailers. Refresh to reload the movie

## Future-Development

- In the future, we want to add the entire library that is available on OMDB. We want to be able to add a genre link, so that we arent focusing on just the list of 6 movies that we added. By adding the entire list of genres, we would have an almost limitless amount of movies. 
- We also want to add a dynamic way to add youtube links, instead of us having to manually apply each one.
- We need to fix a bug with error loading videos due to reloading the page too fast

## Elevator-Pitch

Hyperion is an app that we created to take the thought away from enjoying cult movies without having to do the research yourself! Instead of taking the time to have to look up reviews, and then find trailers, we have streamlined the process so that everything is taken out of your hands, and into ours. Now you can find cult classic titles, trailers, plots, and even ratings at the click of the button.
