# Group-Project-1

Just checking in with some changes to be applied
As a Sci-Fi fanatic, I want to create an app/website that will recommend a new movie for me to watch that I have not already seen so I can find new films based on my criteria entered.

SCOPE:

1. See random movies sugestions with description from OMDB
2. See location of theaters near you from google maps

Next Steps:
1. Add trailers rather than movie image
2. Add abilitiy to "like" a trailer creating a list of movies for the user
3. Add search functionality to narrow scope
4.
